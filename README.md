This repository contains building instructions for a LEGO® robot that can be used while preparing to enter a competition.

**This is not a model to be used in unmodified form in a competition such as the FIRST® LEGO® League. Rather, it serves as a quick and uncomplicated introduction in the preparation phase of a competition.**  
The model shows the basic construction ideas of a modular robot and may serve as a source of inspiration for own, improved models for participation in a competition. 

All parts of the basic robot come from the LEGO® Education SPIKE® Prime and its expansion set.  

The frame parts are in different colors and do not come from these sets. They can be purchased from the relevant Internet sites.
